				<line>
					Personal Timetable: Administrators and schedule deputies can see instructor / student  class / examination schedules even when
					the session does not allow instructors / students to see their schedules (session status does not have the no-role reports flag(s) enabled).
				</line>
				<line>
					Event grid (all resources): When a range of two or more weeks is selected (but not All Weeks), display dates for events that do not meet every
					week in the range. This fixes the issue of not showing dates at all when there is a range of two or more weeks selected.
