			<description>
				<line>
					Personal Timetable: Administrators and schedule deputies can see instructor / student  class / examination schedules even when
					the session does not allow instructors / students to see their schedules (session status does not have the no-role reports flag(s) enabled).
				</line>
				<line>
					Event grid (all resources): When a range of two or more weeks is selected (but not All Weeks), display dates for events that do not meet every
					week in the range. This fixes the issue of not showing dates at all when there is a range of two or more weeks selected.

			<name>Precedence Constraint</name>
			<description>
				<line>Precedence constraint now considers date patterns.
					I.e., if two classes (with a precedence constraint) have different date patterns, it also checks on what dates the first meetings occur.
				<line>This means that the first meeting of the first class must happen before the first meeting of the second class.</line>
				<line>Example: If the first class has date pattern Week 1 and the second class has Week 2, first class will always precede the second class.</line>
				<line>Former behavior (date patterns are ignored) can be enabled by setting the solver property Precedence.ConsiderDatePatterns to false (defaults to true).</line>
